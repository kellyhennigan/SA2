- make run times 8 min 12 sec

remember: 
* start new protocol with: 
	t1-weighted
	t2 scan
	shim
	mux scan 

* be sure to check the fermi filter!! 
* take screen shots of all prescriptions
* make sure responses are being recorded 
* make sure the number of slices is <= the max # possible with 	a given TR

- scans: 

- 1) 3 Phase loc
- 2) shim
- 3) calbration 1
- 3) mux3 rest state (have grace do practice MID run)
- 4) calibration scan
- 5) mux3 MID run1
- 6) calbration scan
- 7) mux1 MID run2
- 8) t1-weighted scan 
- 9) t2 scan

when running tyler, the MID task started 12 seconds after triggering the scanner

Questions for Bob: 

with the regular MUX1, the phases per acquisition set in that box is the number of volumes in the nifti file, whereas for the mux3, 4 less volumes are returned. 

For MUX1 and MUX 3, for a total of 270 TRs acquired: 
n phases: 
268 for MUX1
264 for MUX3

the # of volumes in the nifti are: 
268 for MUX1
260 for MUX3



_____

slice timing correction: 

_______

total scan time (total TRs): 
n phases + mux * arc

# of nifti TRs: 
n phases - 2*mux*(arc-1)+2

_______

# of acquired calibration TRs: 

# cal TRs acquired = mux * (arc - 1) *2

# cal TRs in nifti = (arc - 1)*2

----------

total # of TRs acquired = n phases + mux * arc

total # of calibration TRs = mux * arc * 2

total # of usable TRs = n phases - 2 * mux

total # of 


total calibration time in the beginning of the scan (not usable TRs): TR * 


total # of usable (non-calibrated scans): n phases - 2 * mux

2/22/14

scanning grace: 

- long scan was set to 248 phases per loc
- 2 shorter scans were 124 phases per loc
- 1st 2 scans were mux 3
- 3rd scan was mux 1

all were resting state
