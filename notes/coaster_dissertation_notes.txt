for functional imaging parameters: 
“The 3-D FFE scans produced fewer distortions and higher TSNR in the midbrain than the 2-D EPI scans. “

“
From the retrospective cardiac gated scan, brainstem motion was determined to be most prominent in the inferior and anterior directions. However, the overall75
displacement of the midbrain ROIs was less than 5% of a voxel volume, suggesting that motion associated with cardiac pulsatility did not significantly contribute to the noise in the midbrain.
